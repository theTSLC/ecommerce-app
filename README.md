This is my way of getting some more hands on practice with GraphQL, Apollo, and TypeScript outside of work
 - efficent learning by implementing the Advanced React and GraphQL course by Wes Bos

### Ok, so what is it?

It's a fake clothing store project built using custom hooks, SSR, styled components, user authentication and registration, pagination, sending email, login flow, roles and permissions, charging credit cards, hosting and transforming images, unit testing, mocking components, and more...

### Frontend stack

Front end is built using Next.js, Styled Components, React-Apollo, Jest and Enzyme. As well as Apollo-Client to manage queries and mutations, caching and local state.

- to run locally just execute the commands inside `/package.json`
  - `npm i` && `npm run dev`

### Backend stack

Back end is built with Node.js, Express, Apollo-Server for the queries and mutations resolvers, as well as the server side logic. Database is managed by Prisma

- to run locally just execute the commands inside `/package.json`
  - `npm i` && `npm run dev`
